# Lefover Love

## Overview 
LeftoverLove is a compassionate platform designed to bridge the gap between individuals experiencing homelessness or facing economic hardships and establishments, such as restaurants and grocery stores, with surplus resources like food and clothing. With approximately 66% of homeless individuals owning smartphones and 86% accessing the internet at least once a week, our platform harnesses the power of technology to facilitate connections and distribute resources efficiently, fostering a community of support and solidarity.
